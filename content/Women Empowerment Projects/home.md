Women empowerment projects encourage them to improve their livelihood. We have
formed Self Help Groups (SHG) for women to be independent. **Empowering women is
everyone’s basic duty and we appeal to everyone who is reading this to take care
of the women in your family and give your love, time, energy and financial
freedom for them**. When women in your family live happily, the society grows
and so does a Nation.

Our trust supports women to live with dignity. We create awareness about the
importance of education to them and their children. The SHG takes care of their
financial need by training them with small business opportunities. LIC gives
every woman their basic insurance needed to live peacefully.

Women’s Self Help Group (SHG)
-----------------------------

We formed the SHG on 2016 May and now, there are more than 2500 women
associations. Our trust works in solving the burning challenges women face in
their daily life. Some are gender inequality inside a family and workplace,
sexual harassment, physical and mental stress, financial burden, etc.
