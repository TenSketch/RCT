Women empowerment projects encourage them to improve their livelihood. We have formed Self Help Groups (SHG) for women to be independent. **Empowering women is everyone’s basic duty and we appeal to everyone who is reading this to take care of the women in your family and give your love, time, energy and financial freedom for them**. When women in your family live happily, the society grows and so does a Nation.

Our trust supports women to live with dignity. We create awareness about the importance of education to them and their children. The SHG takes care of their financial need by training them with small business opportunities. LIC gives every woman their basic insurance needed to live peacefully.
