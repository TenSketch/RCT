Aged people are the most uncared for and isolated members of society. Many of the families feel that aged parents are a burden to the growth of the family. It is difficult for poor families to support their aged members and often these people are left without care.

_Based on the objectives of the trust, the following activities have been carried out successfully for the past 10 years:_

 - Creating security by placing them in their own homes
 - Extending counselling to create self-confidence
 - Carrying out health programs
 - Extending recreation programs to refresh their mind and body
 - Distributing basic amenities
 - Reunion with the families
 - Accommodating helpless in the ageing home
