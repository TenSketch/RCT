> The main aim of this program is to create awareness among people, especially those most disadvantaged in society, about the welfare measures. Real Charitable Trust has been concentrating more awareness programs to highlight the State and Central government schemes in all developmental sectors. 

Programs, such as awareness camps, seminars, rallies, etc., are conducted regularly with the help of government agencies and like-minded NGOs. These programs encourage people to utilize government organizationsâ€™ facilities in the promotion of their own personal development. 

_The following activities are a part of this endeavour:_

 - Creating awareness about government schemes
 - Creating awareness on the Right to get Information Act
 - Tapping government resources and schemes
 - Tapping education loans and other facilities such as banks and other government agencies
 - Initiating government schemes for weaker sections, especially for Scheduled Cast and Scheduled Tribe
 - Tapping schemes such as monetary benefits for the ageing, abandoned children & women, differently-abled people, and people living with HIV/AIDS
 - Tapping housing schemes such as Patta for the weaker sections
 - Motivation to utilize voter ID & Ration Cards
 - Initiating different welfare schemes for unorganized sector workers and creating networks among other like-minded NGOs
