> It is important to have a strong foundation in every aspect of the personality such as emotional, social, mental and physical of children. We aim was to develop positive school cultures on the basis of the rights of the child and to improve achievement for all children through having schools and early childhood education centres become learning communities that know, promote, and live human rights and responsibilities. At present, our trust reaches out around 1200 children in the slums of north Chennai as well as rural areas through the following programs,
 
 - Initiate children Sangam
 - Supplementary Education Centres
 - Day Care Centres
 - Enrolment of dropouts in the schools
 - Prevention of Child Labours
