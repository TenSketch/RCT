&emsp;&emsp;The government had initiated the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme in 1988 to rehabilitate working children in 12 child labour endemic districts of the country. The project societies are required to conduct a survey to identify children working in hazardous occupations and processes. These children will then form the target group for the project society. Of the children identified those in the age group 5-8 years will have to be mainstreamed directly to the formal education system through the SSA. Working children in the age group of 9- 14 years will have to be rehabilitated through NCLP schools established by the Project Society. With the support of NCLP, we could train 80 students in Air Conditioner, Refrigerator and Mobile mechanic for 80 at Royapuram Observation Home.
