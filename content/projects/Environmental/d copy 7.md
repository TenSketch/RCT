CRISIL Foundation, as it stands today, is a public charitable trust. Set up in March 2013, we are CRISIL’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) arm, reaching out to socially and economically disadvantaged communities within and beyond our areas of operations. CRISIL Foundation’s flagship financial capability-building programme empowers disadvantaged communities by strengthening their financial capabilities.

Real Charitable Trust is much privileged to be connected with CRISIL’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) arm. We had been with the alliance of CRISIL by the concept of 360-degree Approach, to equip and empower the rag pickers through the solid waste management system. This programme designed mainly for the disadvantaged communities, we had been working with the rag pickers of in and around the Kodunkaiyur dumping yard and around this place.
