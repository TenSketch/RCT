The Clean My Transport Nagar (CMTN) targets to improve waste management and cleanliness of certain transport Nagar (hubs) in India. The initiative also aims to generate awareness on health and sanitation among stakeholders.

We are being in these activities since from 2015, and implementing the mission of Apollo Tyres Foundation “Clean My Transport Nagar”. Initially, we began to work with the collaboration of CAG, and later we independently worked with the direct alliance of Apollo Tyres Foundation.
