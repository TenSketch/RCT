We feel that today's generation has better compassion and respect for the elders, than their previous generation which witnessed a lot of financial and family hurdles forcing them to leave elders at old age homes or alone. If you take social media and cinema,youngsters share a lot of useful thoughts and messages about caring elders. We at RCT, has given old age homes, not just for accommodation and food, but also to enable to join with their families again, provide employment, healthcare and complete rehabilitation.

## NULM-Shelter for urban homeless men (2016-2018)

National Urban Livelihood Mission (NULM) aims at providing permanent shelter equipped with essential services to the urban homeless in a phased manner under the Scheme of Shelter for Urban Homeless (SUH).

### Objectives

1. Ensure availability and access of the urban homeless population to permanent shelters with basic infrastructure facilities like water supply, sanitation, safety and security.
2. Cater to the needs of vulnerable segments of the urban homeless like the dependent children, aged, disabled and mentally ill by creating special sections within homeless shelters and provisioning special service linkages for them.
3. Provide access to various entitlements like social security pension, PDS, ICDS, identity card, financial inclusion, education, affordable housing etc.
4. Formulate structure and framework of engagement for development, management and monitoring of shelters by state and civil society organizations.

There are nearly more than 20,000 homeless people in Chennai by unofficial count. Their lives are a constant struggle against poverty and oppression. Most of them work as waste pickers, rickshaw pullers, construction workers, pushcart vendors and in small eateries, tea shops, etc.

As dusk sets in, they yearn for a place to stay and for a morsel of food with their half-empty stomachs and tired bodies. As poor homeless people, they do not have any such shelter to spend the night and the money they had earned is hardly enough to alleviate their hunger. Hence they sleep on pavements, bus stands, parks and other quiet places they could find and spend the night. With speeding vehicles in roads, mosquitoes, stray dogs, and lurking dangers, their nights are often dangerous and sleepless. Notwithstanding this, they have to arise and go to work, lest they go hungry. There are also dangers from rowdy elements who can harm them and there have been many instances in which those who slept on pavements, meeting with cruel deaths.
