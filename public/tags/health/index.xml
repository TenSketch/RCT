      <description>The main aim of this program is to create awareness among people, especially those most disadvantaged in society, about the welfare measures. Real Charitable Trust has been concentrating more awareness programs to highlight the State and Central government schemes in all developmental sectors.
 Programs, such as awareness camps, seminars, rallies, etc., are conducted regularly with the help of government agencies and like-minded NGOs. These programs encourage people to utilize government organizationsâ€™ facilities in the promotion of their own personal development.</description>
