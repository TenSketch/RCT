                    <p>Every child has the right to good education and health. The future of a nation mainly depends on the Gross National Happiness which is proportionate to the growth and development of children.</p>
<p>Real Charitable Trust focusses on nurturing the personal and social life of children. The goal is to provide equal rights to every child without any social, economic and religious differences. RCT served more than 1500 children in and around the slums of Chennai.

<li>To conduct events for and promote the livelihood of children.</li>
<li>To organize a summer camp for Personality Development</li>

</ul>
<p>In 2007, we formed the supplementary education centre in Chennai to help children after school <strong>Around 862 Children have been benefited through 18 centres</strong> in and around Chennai.</p>
<p>As a part of this, we organized <strong>summer camp for Personality Development</strong> for Children. In this camp, school headmaster, personnel from All Women Police Station, representatives from Allegation Management, Experts from the various sector presided. In this program, children learnt how to use a bank, book tickets, etc. An awareness of the ill-effects of drug addiction was also given to them. Children magazine were printed which contains case studies, stories, proverbs, creative paintings, poems etc.</p>
<p>Parent-Teacher meeting is conducted once in six months. During the meet, open discussions about the education system, performance and ambition of the students are carried out.</p>
<h2 id="day-care-centre">Day Care Centre</h2>
<p>We have built day-care centres to provide care for children whose parents go for work. We give them food, rest engage them in sports, games and learning activities. This gives a stimulating environment for children in the age group of 0-6 years in rural areas. We organized awareness programs for parents on how to take care of the health and education of their children and spend quality time with kids after work. We also highlighted the risk factors and vulnerabilities (especially for girls) which school teens are open to when they are left alone at home and outside.</p>
<h2 id="general-medical-camp">General Medical Camp</h2>
<p><strong>On November 11 2015</strong> we organized a <strong>General Medical camp in Kazhanipakkam village of Thirukazhukundrtam</strong> with the support of local leaders and volunteers. The objective of the medical camp is to create awareness and providing medical care to rural and urban dwellers. It was inaugurated by Mr Jegadeesan of Iyakkam India NGO at Kazhanipakkam. A team of doctors and healthcare providers facilitated the camp. <strong>Around 250 Children were benefited.</strong></p>
<p>Some of the children are referred to Government General Hospital for further treatment and medicines were distributed. Hand notices on general awareness on health and hygiene were distributed to people in the village.</p>
<p>RCT conducted <strong>Global Handwashing day October 15 and Children's Day November 14 2019</strong> programs. <strong>652 children</strong> participated in the event. Child Nutrition Supervisors and PTA leaders attended the event. Demonstration on Handwashing and preparation of low-cost nutrition were carried out. Children were grouped into health clubs and were monitored for following personal hygiene while taking food and in schools and home.</p>
<p><strong>Special medical camp for rag-picking children</strong> to treat and prevent those who are vulnerable to diseases such as TB, Asthma, etc. We assessed their health condition and provided awareness on safety and hygiene on how to take care of themselves during work. From this camp, around 120 rag pickers community people got benefitted. We also administered Vitamin tablets to develop their immunity. Mr. Lawrence expressed his gratitude to volunteers.</p>
<h2 id="child-labour-prevention">Child Labour Prevention</h2>
<p>The National Child Labour Prevention Program was conducted in the Government observation home at Royapuram with support of Chennai Corporation. Majority of the slum children have discontinued their studies and are employed as child labourers due to poverty and family challenges.</p>
<p>We formed this intervention in 2008 and identified the child labours in the Wall Tax Road, Sarma Nagar, Ambattur Estate, Guindy, Madavaram, Thirumazhisai, Thirumudivakkam and Korukkupet. Most of these children were employed as rag pickers in the Ezhil Nagar dumping yard. Around 125 children have been enrolled in regular school through this intervention in urban and rural areas. The team also sends children to vocational training centres for improving their skills.</p>

<h2 id="school-intervention-programs">School Intervention Programs</h2>
<p>The objective of this program is to <strong>promote Child Rights and Health Awareness</strong>. Training and awareness programs were given to school children on child rights. In Thiruvallur district, the students were educated on using the Childline-1098 and HIV/AIDS awareness with the support of IAPA - International Alliance for Prevention of AIDS.
