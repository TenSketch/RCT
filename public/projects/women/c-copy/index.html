<p>&emsp;There are nearly more than 20,000 homeless people in Chennai, by unofficial count. Their lives are a constant struggle against poverty and oppression. Most of them work during the day, as waste pickers, rickshaw pullers, construction workers, pushcart vendors, workers in small eateries, tea shops and so on.</p>

<p>As dusk sets in, their half-empty stomachs and tired bodies yearn for a place to stay and for a morsel of food. As poor homeless people, they do not have any such shelter to spend the night and the money they had earned is hardly enough to alleviate their hunger. Hence they sleep on pavements, bus stands, parks and other quiet places they could find and spend the night. With mosquitoes, stray dogs, and lurking dangers, their nights are often sleepless. Notwithstanding this, they have to arise and go to work, lest they go hungry.</p>

<p>There are also dangers from rowdy elements who can harm them and there have been many instances in which those who slept on pavements, meeting with cruel deaths.</p>

<p><em>Hence Real Trust embarked on a project to reach out to these hapless people and provide them shelter, food, and safety. The strategy consists of the following:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Identification of homeless individuals</li>
<li>Collect data about them</li>
<li>Provide counselling<br /></li>
<li>Food and shelter</li>
<li>Regular medical check-up</li>
<li>Recreation</li>
<li>Reuniting with families</li>
