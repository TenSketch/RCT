We feel that todayâ€™s generation has better compassion and respect for the elders, than their previous generation which witnessed a lot of financial and family hurdles forcing them to leave elders at old age homes or alone. If you take social media and cinema, youngsters share a lot of useful thoughts about caring elders. We at RCT, has given old age homes, not just for accommodation and food, but also to enable to join with their families again, provide employment for the abled, healthcare and complete rehabilitation.
