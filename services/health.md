We work to create awareness about health and hygiene among people in need. Real Charitable Trust highlights the schemes of State and Central government. Programs such as awareness camps, seminars, rallies, etc., are conducted regularly with the help of government agencies and other NGOs. These programs encourage people to utilize the governmentâ€™s facilities and get benefited.
