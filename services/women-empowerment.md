This is our special service to encourage women in need to improve their livelihood. We have formed Self Help Groups (SHGs) for women to be independent. Empowering women is everyone’s basic duty and we appeal to everyone who is reading this to take care of the women in your family and give your love, time, energy and financial freedom for them. If your family’s women are living better, the society develops automatically and so does the Nation.
